# DrTWiT
TWiT Electron App


# How this was made:

I have a custom set of instructions that I created called IcarusShell (included).  I told it the app I wanted, and to start by making a scaffold.md per Icarus (included but editted by the AI as it worked).

The rest was just running and troubleshooting and vibe coding.

# Bugs

I vibe coded this, so I wont' be issuing bug fixes unless it bugs me.  Feel free to fork and go nuts!
